# Semantic Snippets: Search Without Limits 🔍

> "Not every idea needs a platform. Some just need a function and a file."

## The Problem

Traditional search is limited by exact matches and keywords. Finding relevant information requires knowing the right words to search for.

## The Solution

[chromem-go](https://github.com/philippgille/chromem-go) enables semantic search that understands meaning, not just words. Find relevant information even when the exact words don't match.

This demo shows how chromem-go makes semantic documentation search feel natural. We'll:

1. Load 50-100 documentation snippets
2. Include variety: CLI tools, programming concepts, system operations
3. Perform semantic searches over the snippets
4. Show how results understand context, not just keywords

## Running the Demo

```bash
go run main.go
```

## What You'll See

The demo demonstrates practical semantic search:

- Searching over real documentation snippets
- Results that understand context
- How semantic search beats keyword matching
- The simplicity of local-first search

## The Big Idea

This demo shows how chromem-go enables local intelligence patterns:

```go
// Load and search documentation
docs := loadDocumentation()
collection := chromem.NewCollection()
collection.Add(docs)
results := collection.Query("how do I configure the system?")
```

Like `json.Marshal()` but for similarity.

## Practical Applications

- CLI tools that need offline semantic search
- Edge deployments with intermittent connectivity
- Developer tools doing code similarity matching
- Internal apps with embedding-based recommendations
- Observability systems correlating traces semantically

## Next Steps

- Return to `01_hello_searchless` to see the basics
- Try `02_similarity_modes` to understand different distance metrics
- Check out `03_persist_reload` to learn about persistence

## Why This Matters

The best infrastructure is the infrastructure you forget exists. chromem-go doesn't want to be your vector platform - it wants to be a function call that happens to remember things.
